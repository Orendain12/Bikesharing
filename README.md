Summary
Through visual implication bike sharing services seem to do well in high metropolitan location like Manhattan. It provides a great alternative to mode of transport, car, bus, train, and taxi’s. The utilization of users is dominated by male riders in the month of August. 
It would be hard to determine if creating a bike sharing service would do well in Des Moines, IA. We would need to determine population variations between Manhattan and Des Moines. What does the population density look like between the two. 
In addition weather would play a pretty large factor in this decision as well. There would be several months that bike sharing services would not be ideal. This is something that would need to be factored into the decision making. 

Additional visualizations could steam around data census on population and weather data for a full 12 month term.
